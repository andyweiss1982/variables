## var

* Kind of old school, but valid
* Can be declared as many times as you like

```
var rhyme = 1
var rhyme = 2
var rhyme = "buckle my shoe"
var rhyme = 3
var rhyme = 4
var rhyme = "shut the door"
```

* Best practice to declare at top of scope

```js
var rhyme

rhyme = 1
rhyme = 2
rhyme = "buckle my shoe"
rhyme = 3
rhyme = 4
rhyme = "shut the door"

```
