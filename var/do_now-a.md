### Do Now

* Count the combined total number of heads, shoulders, knees and toes in the room.
* If there were 17 people in the room, what would the number be?

```js
17 * 1 + 17 * 2 + 17 * 2 + 17 * 10
// => 255
```

```
var people = 17

var heads     = people * 1
var shoulders = people * 2
var knees     = people * 2
var toes      = people * 10

heads + shoulders + knees + toes
// => 255
```
