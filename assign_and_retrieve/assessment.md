### Assessment

Tell us another story, declare constants and variables for some of the people in your life, e.g.:

* Your `mom`
* Your `lastBoss`
* Your `favoriteTeacher`
* Tell us some of your `interests`

Try to use a combination of numbers, strings, arrays and objects.  Change some of the values over time to make the story interesting.  Explain in a comment why you chose each data structure, and why you assigned it to a constant or variable.

Post your answer to `repl.it` and email it to andyweiss1982@gmail.com.
