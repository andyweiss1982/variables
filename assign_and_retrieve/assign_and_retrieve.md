### Assignment

* `const`: set it and forget it
* `var` and `let` can be reassigned

```js
const name              = "Andy"
const birthplace        = "New Jersey"
let   age               = 31
let   job               = "teacher"
let   careerAspiration  = "developer"

age = age + 1
job = careerAspiration
age += 1
age += 1
age += 1
careerAspiration = "teacher"
```
