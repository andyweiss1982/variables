### Assignment

* `const`: set it and forget it

```js
const name              = "Andy"
const birthplace        = "New Jersey"
const age               = 31
const job               = "teacher"
const careerAspiration  = "developer"
```

### Retrieval

* String interpolation

### More Retrieval

Arrays are zero-indexed

```js
const cities = ["Miami", "New York", "Los Angeles"]

cities[0]
// => "Miami"

cities[1]
// => "New York"
```

---

### Even More Retrieval

Objects can be retrieved by key

```js
const foo = { hello: 'world', ok: 'go' }

foo.hello
// => 'world'

foo['ok']
// => 'go'
```

### Advanced Retrieval
#### (Working with Variables)

* Math
* Reassignment
* (Use `const` unless you know value will change)
